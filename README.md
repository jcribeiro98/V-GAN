# Introduction 
Repository for the V-GAN algorithm in paper "Adversarial Subspace Generation for Knowledge Discovery in High Dimensional Data" for subspace search.

Our proposed algorithm, V-GAN, is capable of identifying a collection of subspaces relevant to a studied population $\mathbf{X}$. We do so by building on a theoretical framework that explains the _Multiple Views_ phenomenom of data. 
Details of this will be added in the future, alongside a pre-print version of the paper.
